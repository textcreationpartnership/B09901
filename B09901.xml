            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Counteſs of Roſcommon's CASE.</head>
            <p>IN the 35<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. <hi>Thomas Walcott</hi> was indicted for High-Treaſon, in Compaſſing the Death of the King by Aſſaſſination; and being tryed before Sir <hi>Francis Pemberton</hi> and others, he was thereof convicted; And the Judgment, or rather the Minutes of the Judgment that was entered on the top of the Indictment (it being the Courſe and Practice to enter over every Priſoner's Name in the Indictment in a compendious manner the Priſoner's Plea, the Verdict of the Jury, and the Judgment of the Court thereupon) is thus Recorded:
<q>Ponit ſe <hi>(which is the Plea)</hi> culpabil cat. nul. <hi>(which is the Verdict of the Jury) and then followeth the Judgment, thus:</hi> Conſiderat. eſt quod ducatur ad Gaolam Domini Regis de <hi>Newgate</hi> unde venit; &amp; ibidem ſuper bigam ponatur; &amp; abinde uſque ad Furcas de <hi>Tyburne</hi> trahatur, &amp; ibidem per collum ſuſpendatur, &amp; vivens ad Terram proſternatur. Et quod ſecreta membra ejus Amputentur, &amp; interiora ſua extra ventrem ſuam capiantùr <hi>(ipſoque vivente)</hi> comburantur, &amp; quod caput ejus Amputetur. Quodque corpus ejus in quatuor partes dividatur, &amp; quod caput &amp; quarteria illa po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantur ubi Dominus Rex ea Aſſignare voluerit.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But in the Record drawn up hereupon (which contains and recites at large the whole Proceedings againſt the Priſoner; which Record is certified into the <hi>King's-Bench</hi> on a Writ of Error); the Judgment is thus entred;
<q>Ideo Conſiderat. eſt per Cur. hic, quod proedictus <hi>Thomas Walcott</hi> Ducatur ad Gaolam Domini Regis de <hi>Newgate</hi> unde venit; &amp; ibidem ſuper Bigam pona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur; &amp; abinde uſque ad Furcas de <hi>Tyburne</hi> trahatur, &amp; ibidem per collum ſuſpendatur, &amp; vivens ad terram proſternatur. Et. quod ſecreta membin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>So that the only variance between the Minutes of the Judgment given by the Court, and the Judgment certified into the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> on the Writ of Error, is, that in the firſt, thoſe words <hi>(ipſo vivente)</hi> are inſerted, and part of the Judgment; but in the latter they are left out.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Eaſter</hi>-Term laſt was twelve-month, <hi>John Walcott,</hi> the Son and Heir of
<hi>Thomas,</hi> obtained a Writ of Error to Reverſe his Father's Attainder as Erroneous, and the Exception that was taken and inſiſted upon, to reverſe the Attainder, was this, That the words <hi>(ipſo vivente)</hi> are omitted, and no part of the Judgment. But the Court being informed that the Counteſs of <hi>Roſcommon</hi> (whoſe Husband had a Grant from the Crown, of Mr. <hi>Walcott</hi>'s Eſtate, in conſideration of a juſt Debt) was intereſted under the Attainder; they gave time to hear her Councel in Affirmance of this At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder.</p>
            <p>On this Point the Cauſe hung until this preſent <hi>Trinity</hi> Term; and on
<hi>Friday</hi> the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> inſtant, the Court gave Judgment for reverſing the Attainder, for this Reaſon only, becauſe the words <hi>(ipſo vivente)</hi> were omitted, and not part of the Judgment certified on the Writ of Error; notwithſtanding that it was much inſiſted upon by the Counteſs's Councel, that theſe words are not material; and that it is impoſſible in Nature for the Man to be alive after his Heart and Bowels are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of his Body: Nor would the Court amend and rectify the Record certified on the Writ of Error, by the Minutes of the Judgment entered on the Indictment; though it plainly appeared to them, by the Minutes of the Judgment entered on the Indictment, which was produced in Court, that Judgment was given by the Court that his Bowels ſhould be burnt while he was alive: but the words <hi>(ipſo vivente)</hi> were either unwarrantably, or by miſtake, left out by the Clerk, who drew up the Record of Attainder by thoſe Minutes.</p>
